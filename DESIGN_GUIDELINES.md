# Design Guidelines

## Color Scheme
- Primary Color: #3498db (Blue)    <!-- Blue gives a professional tone to the resume -->
- Accent Color: #2ecc71 (Green)    <!-- Green adds freshness to the overall look -->
- Neutral Color: #ecf0f1 (Light Gray)    <!-- Light Gray maintains balance between vibrant colors -->

## Typography
- Primary Font: Lato (Google Font)   <!-- Lato is chosen for its modern, clean appearance -->
- Fallback: Helvetica, sans-serif    <!-- Provides a fallback font for compatibility -->

## Layout Principles
- A clean, minimalistic one-column layout for mobile devices, switching to a two-column layout for larger screens.
